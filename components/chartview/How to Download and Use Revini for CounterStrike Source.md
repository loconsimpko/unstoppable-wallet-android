## What is Rev.ini?
 
Rev.ini is a configuration file that contains various settings for RevEmu, such as language, logging, steam user name, and more. You can edit rev.ini using any text editor, such as Notepad. Rev.ini allows you to control how your server interacts with the Steam network and the players who join your server. For example, you can enable or disable Steam validation, force only RevEmu clients, or change the Steam user name that appears in the server browser.
 
## How to Download Rev.ini?
 
There are several sources where you can download rev.ini for Counter-Strike: Source. One of them is GitHub[^1^], where you can find the latest version of rev.ini along with other files for running a non-steam CS:S server. Another source is Raymond.cc[^2^], where you can find a detailed guide on how to make a non-steam CS:GO server using RevEmu or LumaEmu. You can also download rev.ini from there.
 
## How to Use Rev.ini?
 
After downloading rev.ini, you need to copy it to the folder where srcds.exe resides. This is usually C:\\srcds\\ or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source Dedicated Server\\. Then, you need to edit rev.ini according to your preferences. Here are some of the most important settings that you can change:
 
- **Language**: You can set the language of your server using this option. The possible values are English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, sChinese, Korean, Koreana, tChinese, Japanese, Russian, Thai, or Portugeuse.
- **Logging**: You can enable or disable log file output for steam.dll using this option. The log file will be created in the same folder as srcds.exe.
- **SteamDll**: You can specify the path to your official Steam client DLL using this option. This is required for Steam UserID validation functions to support legit Steam IDs. Otherwise, all clients would get IDs generated from their IP addresses.
- **SteamClient**: You can enable or disable the steamclient emulator using this option. This is recommended to be true for both clients and game servers and for all games, except games which use SteamClient006 interface (e.g. CS: Source).
- **SteamUser**: You can change the steam user name that you wish to use with RevEmu using this option. This will appear in the server browser and in-game.
- **ForceRevClient**: You can force your game server to allow only RevEmu clients and optionally legitimate Steam clients if SteamDLL is enabled using this option. This only applies for old source engine games which use Steam2 validation.

After editing rev.ini, you can start your server normally using srcds.exe or SteamCMD GUI. Your server should now accept both steam and non-steam players who use RevEmu.
