Some of the highlights of CKFinder 2.3 are:
 
- Multiple files selection: You can select multiple files on your server using different methods, such as Ctrl+A, Ctrl+click, Shift+click, or Shift+arrow keys[^1^].
- Drag and drop multiple files: You can drag and drop selected files into different folders or resource types within your server[^1^]. This makes organizing your files easier than ever.
- Maximize plugin: You can enlarge the CKFinder window to get more space to see the files[^1^]. You can also minimize it back to the initial size.
- Zip plugin: You can create, download, and extract zip archives on your server[^1^]. This feature is only available in the PHP version at this moment.
- Additional configuration options: You can customize the initial width of the folders pane, the startup path, and the action on double click[^1^].

CKFinder 2.3 also includes a few server-side changes and bug fixes that improve its performance and stability[^1^]. You can download CKFinder 2.3 from [here](https://ckeditor.com/ckfinder/download/) and try it for a limited period of time[^2^]. If you like it, you can buy a license key to unlock its full functionality[^2^].
